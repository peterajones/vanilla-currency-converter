# Vanilla Currency Converter #

I found this project on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingJourney/videos). A very comprehensive tutorial on how to build a vanilla currency converter.

The tutorial is a two part video.

[Part One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARBvYDNeNdM)

[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4TfBopAmaY)

You can find the original code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Coding_Journey/pen/exjrdghttps://codepen.io/Coding_Journey/pen/exjrdg).

In the tutorial, the flag icons are links to images but I wanted to make this a little more self contained so I grabbed some flags from [flagicons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev).

You will probably waant to use the images included in this repo as there are way more 
icons in the [lipis repo](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css).

You will also need an API KEY from [Exchangeratesapi](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). At the time the videos were recorded, the API KEY was not required but it is required now - **it's free!**

Take a look at the `js/temp.config.js` file - in there you will find instructions on how to get this Vanilla Currency Converter working.

I also added a couple of my own niceties. Can you find them?
